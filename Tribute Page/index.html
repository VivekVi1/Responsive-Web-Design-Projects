                <strong>Chadwick Aaron Boseman </strong>(November 29, 1976 – August 28, 2020) was an American actor and
                playwright. After studying directing at Howard University, he began working consistently as a writer,
                director, and actor for the stage, winning a Drama League Directing Fellowship and an acting AUDELCO,
                and being nominated for a Jeff Award as a playwright for Deep Azure. Transitioning to the screen, he
                landed his first major role as a series regular on Persons Unknown in 2010, and his breakthrough
                performance came in 2013 as baseball player Jackie Robinson in the biographical film 42. He continued to
                portray historical figures, starring as singer James Brown in Get on Up (2014), and as lawyer and future
                Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in Marshall (2017).

                Boseman achieved international fame for playing superhero Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
                (MCU) from 2016 to 2019. He appeared in four MCU films, including an eponymous 2018 film that earned him
                an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture and a Screen Actors Guild Award for
                Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. As the first black actor to headline an MCU film,
                he was also named in the 2018 Time 100.

                In 2016, Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer. He kept his condition private, continuing to act while
                also extensively supporting cancer charities until his death in 2020 from the illness. His final film,
                Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, was released posthumously the same year to critical acclaim, earning him an
                Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.
                Boseman also received four nominations at the 27th Screen Actors Guild Awards for his work in Da 5
                Bloods and Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, the most for a performer at a single ceremony, winning Male
                Actor in a Leading Role for Ma Rainey.

            <ul>
                <li>On August 28, 2020, a Change.org petition was started, seeking to replace a Confederate monument in
                    his hometown of Anderson with a statue of Boseman; it collected more than 50,000 signatures in less
                    than a week, surpassing its original goal of 15,000 signatures.</li>
                <li>Henry McMaster, the Governor of South Carolina, ordered the Statehouse flags be lowered to
                    half-staff on August 30 in honor of Boseman, who was born and raised in the state.[182] ABC (which,
                    like Marvel Entertainment, is owned by Disney) aired a commercial-free version of Black Panther,
                    followed by a special about Boseman's life and work titled Chadwick Boseman — A Tribute for a King
                    on the same day.</li>
                <li>Following his Best Actor win over Boseman at the Academy Awards in April 2021, Anthony Hopkins said,
                    <i> "I want to pay tribute to Chadwick Boseman, who was taken from us far too early, and again thank
                        you all very much."</i>
                </li>
                <li>Also aired on August 30 was the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards; the ceremony was dedicated to Boseman.
                </li>
                <li>On September 24, 2020, Disney unveiled a mural titled King Chad, by artist Nikkolas Smith dedicated
                    to Boseman at Downtown Disney in Anaheim, California.[186] In February 2021, another mural dedicated
                    to Boseman was painted at Trilith Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia, by artist Brandon Sadler.</li>

            <p>Chadwick came to the White House to work with kids when he was playing Jackie Robinson. You could tell
                right away that he was blessed. To be young, gifted, and Black; to use that power to give them heroes to
                look up to; to do it all while in pain – what a use of his years.</p>
